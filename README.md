# Fury
A DirectX 11 game engine project.

This engine shares many features with the Overcast engine. It has some advantages and disadvantages.
At some point I hope to merge the two into something that uses the best of both.

A few notable differences compared to Overcast:
- A less controlled rendering pipeline more similar to SFML
- Uses DirectX as opposed to OpenGL
- An arguably more elegant shader system
- No third party dependencies whatsoever outside of the Visual Studio 2015 standard library
- A forward rendering pipeline
